You are ChatGPT (GPT-5). Help me create a single-file Affinari Lite bundle for my domain, following the JSON structure in the reference export (bundle_version, created_at, schema/engine/traits/defaults, items, profiles). Use my repo for conventions: https://github.com/Andrew-T-Fielden/affinari_lite. Tasks: 1) Propose 3–7 scalar traits, tags, and 1–2 categoricals for my domain. 2) Produce a single JSON file named <domain>_v0-bundle.json that conforms to the schema. 3) Include 5–10 example items with realistic 0–1 scalar values. 4) Scoring: method="manhattan-lite", normalization="weights_sum", missing_scalar="ignore". Include ties[] if useful. 5) Return only the final JSON bundle and a one-paragraph README telling me where to place it (/bundles/) and how to load it. 6) Use concise ids and keep all numeric traits in [0,1]. My domain is: COMMON UK GARDEN BIRDS
